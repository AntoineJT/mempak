# MemPak reader/editor
Allows the user to view the contents of N64 Controller Pak files (.mpk, .n64), export/import notes, delete notes, and save the modified MPK file. Written in plain Javascript and tested in Chrome and Firefox.

* Open notes or MPK files by **Drag and drop** or **browse** for files (incl. multiple files)
* Parses the filesystem verbosely, catching errors without needing to rely on the IndexTable checksum
* **Game code database** - automatically identifies game name
* DexDrive (.n64) support (saves as standard .mpk)
* **Export**, **Import** and **Delete** notes
